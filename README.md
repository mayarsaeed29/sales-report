Applied time intelligence functions to compare sales performance across different periods.

Sales Insights & Visualizations:

Designed visuals to display sales by region and sales by product category.

Highlighted the Top 10 best-selling products using dynamic DAX ranking.

Used slicers and filters to enable interactive exploration of data.

Key Outcomes:

Provided a clear overview of regional sales distribution.

Identified the highest-performing products driving revenue.
